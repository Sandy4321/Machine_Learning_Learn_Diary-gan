MNIST identification with CNN then using K-means to clustering

**Still can't understand how to use K-means to build reduce fuction**

Trying to understand official example: cfair10

This example is wrote in tensorflow-0.11

It's not working in tensorflow-1.2rc0 cause of python api change

I want's to update it to the newest api and create a pull request
